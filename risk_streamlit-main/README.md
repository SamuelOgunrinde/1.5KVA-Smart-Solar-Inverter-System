# Risk Streamlit 🌞⚡

Risk Streamlit is a **solar maintenance monitoring system** built on a **rule-based logic approach** and hosted with **Streamlit**.  
Its main purpose is to classify the operational state of a solar system into **Normal, Low Risk, High Risk, or Critical**, helping operators quickly identify issues and take preventive action.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time monitoring**: Pulls live sensor data via **Supabase** integration  
- **Rule-based classification**: Transparent logic for risk levels (Normal, Low, High, Critical)  
- **Interactive dashboards**: Streamlit-powered UI for easy visualization and decision-making  
- **Scalable design**: Ready to expand with more sensors or advanced models  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** for backend logic  
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboards  
- **Supabase** for real-time data ingestion from sensors
